# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
Preparing Data To Be Used For Later Analysis

This is the peer graded assignment for the course Getting & Cleaning Data on Coursera. I have created a codebook, readme, tidy data textfile(output) and a script which performs the following actions:

1. Downloads the dataset into the directory

2. Loads the activity and feature information into the environment

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

4. Merges the activity and feature columns and finally the datasets.

5. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The final result is stored in 'tiny.txt'
