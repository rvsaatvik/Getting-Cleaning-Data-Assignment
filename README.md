# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
Preparing Data To Be Used For Later Analysis

This is the peer graded assignment for the course Getting & Cleaning Data on Coursera. I have created a codebook, readme, tidy data textfile(output) and a script which performs the following actions:

*item
Downloads the dataset into the directory

*item
Loads the activity and feature information into the environment

*item
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

*item
Merges the activity and feature columns and finally the datasets.

*item
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The final result is stored in tiny.txt
